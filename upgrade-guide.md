## Upgrading In 3 Easy Steps

      <p>Before you finalize your upgrade, remember: in family law, your data is your best defense. We strongly recommend archiving your previous workbooks in a dedicated "Legacy" folder within your Google Drive rather than deleting them.</p>
      <p class="mt-3">Data transfers are generally seamless, but think of your old file as your "Black Box" backup. Keeping the original record ensures that if an export or import is ever corrupted, your timestamped, legal-ready evidence remains 100% intact and retrievable.</p>

      <p>To keep your archives "audit-ready" for an attorney or mediator, avoid generic filenames like "Copy of Parent Record". Use a specific date-range format so you can locate specific evidence in seconds:</p>
      <p class="mt-3 font-semibold text-blue-100">Recommended Format: Archive_ParentRecord_YYYY-MM-DD_to_YYYY-MM-DD</p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-blue-100/90">Example: Archive_CustodyLog_2025-01-01_to_2026-02-11</p>
      <p class="mt-2">Why it works: This naming convention creates a chronological "Status Quo" history that is easy for legal teams to navigate without opening multiple files.</p>

If you are migrating from a version prior to v2.1.0, you will see a warning message indicating that some data columns are missing. **This is to be expected** and does not indicate an error.

1. **Payment_Method** column was added in 2.1.0 to support the addition of Personal Expenses tracking.
2. **Schedule_End_Date** column was added in 2.1.0 to support the addition of flexible scheduling.
3. **Reported_To** column was added in 2.4.0 to support the addition of Domestic Violence Incident tracking.
