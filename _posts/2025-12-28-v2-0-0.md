This release makes My Parent Record feel faster, clearer, and more reliable during the moments you need it most—handoffs, schedule changes, and quick documentation.

## Summary

A total reinvention of the core platform. This release prioritizes Speed, Sovereignty, and Stability, transforming the product from a passive documentation tool into a high-velocity defensive system.

## Protecting Your Peace Requires Precision

_We believe that when you are documenting the truth, you shouldn't have to wait on a loading screen._

In a high-conflict situation, your time is your most valuable asset. When the phone buzzes and the adrenaline spikes, you need a system that acts as an extension of your memory—fast, reliable, and unshakeable. You don't need a spreadsheet that lags; you need a defense system that works as hard as you do.

That is why we didn’t just "update" My Parent Record. We tore it down to the studs and rebuilt it from the ground up. We transformed it from a tool you use into a weapon of truth you wield.

This is My Parent Record v2. It is designed for the Silent Guardian who is ready to move from "overwhelmed" to "CEO of the family."

## Removing the Friction

We heard you. We know that in the past, technical glitches and loading times added unnecessary friction to your day. We took that feedback seriously.

We have completely re-architected the system to eliminate the wait. By integrating every tool into a single, instant-load command center, we’ve removed the "admin fatigue" so you can focus on what matters: your children and your peace.

## Your New Capabilities

Here is how v2.0 turns chaos into order faster than ever before:

### 1. The Speed of Truth (Sidebar & Logging)

You aren't logging for fun; you are logging for protection. We’ve optimized the engine to respect your reality.

**Instant Access:** Sidebars now switch instantaneously. No more waiting for different modules to load.

**Rapid Fire Logging:** Saving an event is now 94% faster.

**Batch Syncing:** You can now log multiple events in a row—dump the mental load immediately—and sync them all to your sheet in one go.

### 2. Visual Command (New Settings & Custody)

Complex custody math is exhausting. We replaced the confusing number patterns with a visual interface that makes sense.

**Visual Pattern Generator:** Build complex, multi-week schedules with a few clicks. See your schedule visualize in real-time before you save it.

**Total Control:** Easily add or remove children and relationships in bulk. Need to restart your schedule? We added a "Clean Slate" feature to delete old patterns instantly.

### 3. The Peace of Proof (Reporting)

Your lawyer doesn't want screenshots; they want data.

**High-Speed Reports:** PDF generation is now 92% faster. Whether you need a report for court tomorrow or a mediator today, it’s ready in seconds.

**Bulletproof Imports:** We’ve built a robust safety net for importing files, ensuring your historical data remains safe during upgrades.
