## New Features: Built for Your Reality

We’ve been listening closely to your feedback, and this update is all about making your co-parenting workflow as smooth and secure as possible. Every update we push is designed to ensure your evidence is audit-ready and reflects the true complexity of your life.

## The Improvements

### 1. Domestic Violence & Family Safety

**The Request:**

> I would like to log domestic violence incidents and other relevant events that coincide with divorce/custody.

**The Solution:**

When you’re in the middle of a high-conflict case, "Other" isn't a descriptive enough category for your attorney. We’ve introduced **Domestic Violence Incident** as a first-class logging sub-category. You can now tag specific behaviors like _Coercive Control_, _Stalking_, and _Intimidation_ with legal-grade precision.

Additionally, we added a **"Reported To"** selector. This allows you to instantly link an incident to a police report, Child Protective Services, or a mediator, building a chronological "trail of evidence" that proves a consistent pattern of behavior over time.

### 2. Blended Family Recognition: The Stepparent Role

**The Request:**

> One suggestion I have that may help in some cases is adding an option to add a step parent. If the step parents are involved and communicate with the other custodial parent that would be an easy way to keep up with all communication from all parties involved.

**The Solution:**

In family law, accuracy is everything, but so is legal distinction. While stepparents often do the heavy lifting, they occupy a unique legal space. We've added "Stepparent" as a secondary role in your People settings to capture your operational reality without blurring legal lines.

While the Custody Calendar remains focused on the primary legal parents to ensure your overnight percentages stay accurate for child support, the Stepparent role is now fully supported in your daily Schedule & Parenting Time logs, Communication logs, Incident Reports, and all other log events. This ensures your logs provide a 100% factual representation of the adults physically involved in your children's lives, providing your attorney with a clear picture of who is actually present during transitions and events.

## A Note From Us: Your Reality Drives Our Roadmap

Every major feature in this update started as a message from a parent navigating the complex, often stressful reality of family law.

When you take the time to tell us, “I need to document this specific pattern,” or “The app needs to reflect who is actually present at exchanges,” you aren’t just helping yourself—you’re building a more robust safety net for every other parent using this tool. The new Domestic Violence Incident logging exists because a parent requested it for their situation. The new Stepparent role was added because a family needed to log their daily operational truth without compromising their primary legal custody math.

Your reality drives our roadmap. If there is a feature that would make your life easier, your documentation clearer, or your journey through the legal system a little more organized, please let us know. We are listening.

## A Small Favor: Help Us Reach More Parents

We are a small team, and we rely entirely on word-of-mouth. If this app has given you a little more peace of mind, would you consider leaving a quick review on Etsy? It takes less than 60 seconds, but for a parent searching for a "safety net" in a tough moment, your review might be the reason they finally find the tool they need. You’re not just helping us; you’re helping another parent find their footing.
