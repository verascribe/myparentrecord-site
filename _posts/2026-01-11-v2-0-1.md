      - "**Settings Sidebar:** Added explicit Add buttons next to the Child Name and Person Name input fields. This clarifies the two-step process (Add Entity → Save Changes) for new users who may not intuit pressing Enter."
      - "**UI/UX:** Updated button behaviors in the Settings forms. The Add buttons now correctly display a pointer cursor on hover and are visually disabled when the input field is empty to prevent blank entries."

We noticed that adding new names in the Settings menu wasn't as intuitive as it could be. In v2.0.1, we added explicit **"Add" buttons** next to the Child and Person fields, removing the guesswork of needing to press "Enter." We also polished the visual feedback to ensure buttons clearly show when they are ready to be clicked.
