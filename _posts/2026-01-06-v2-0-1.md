  - name: "UI/UX Improvements"
    items:
      - "**Settings Sidebar:** Added explicit Add buttons next to the Child Name and Person Name input fields. This clarifies the two-step process (Add Entity → Save Changes) for new users who may not intuit pressing Enter."
      - "**UI/UX:** Updated button behaviors in the Settings forms. The Add buttons now correctly display a pointer cursor on hover and are visually disabled when the input field is empty to prevent blank entries."
